Open Source Security Foundation's whole purpose is to improve security for open-source software.

In this article I will give a brief about different projects and which might be suitable for you if you are intersted in contributing. Irrespective of which ever working group you join in OpenSSF you can always learn something out about software supply chain security.

## Gittuf
It is a security layer for Git which tries to provide controls and methodology to protect from forge level supply chain issues.  
### Suitability
If you are someone who want to learn internally about how version control systems work and contribute on Git tooling this can be suitable for you. You can also learn a lot of cryptography here.

## OpenSSF Scorecard
This tool checks for vulnerabilities in software supply chain layers such as code, build, dependencies, testing and maintenance.
### Suitability
If you are someone who actively writes code, participating in this working group will teach you security practices.

## Sigstore
This is a service which enable us to sign software artificats such as file,container, sourc code, etc and allows for verification. There is also a transparency log called Rekor
### Suitability
If you are someone who wants to learn about cryptography or general software development, this can be a good group. But as this is a graduated project in OpenSSF, there might be less activity.

## SLSA
This is a framework which aims to provide securiy levels for software in different levels of supply chain such as source, build, dependency.
### Suitability
Participating in this working group can help someone to learn a lot and go deep into supply chain security and controls to protect software supply chain.

## SBOMit
This provides a specification which helps us to get a assurances about a software.
### Suitability
You can learn about SBOMs and in-toto attestations and layouts.

## OpenBao
This is a fork of HashiCorp vault which provides a solutio to manage, store and distribute sensitive data, secrets, and certificates.
### Suitability
If you want to learn about data security & identity security and how they can be operationalized in a company. This can be useful group to join.

## AllStar
This is more like a secure project management tool, which automatically creates an alert in policy is violated and automatically perform changes in the project. This is a Github App.
### Suitability
If you are someone who want to learn Github project policy side of things and automating fixing this can be a good one.

## Alpha-Omega
This is more like an security auditing initiative for open-source projecs. 
### Suitability
You can be part of this to active collaborate with famous open-source projects to learn and contribute security.
