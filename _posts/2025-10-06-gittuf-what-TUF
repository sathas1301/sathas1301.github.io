Why?
Remove single source of trust on git server
Independently verify policies without trusting forge
verifiable way to authenticate developers - there in git
log of repo activity - not git log - who pushed what to which part of repo - Reference state log
Repository policy - verifiable and transparent representation of repo policy

policy protections built on top of repository by froges like github/gitlab but not into repo

Main concepts
Root of Trust
delegations - ability to grant trust for a namespace
Thresholds - min number of signatures
signing key
policy file
reference state log
rules

What it provides
Repository Activity
-> reference - refs/gittuf/reference-state-log
every commit is signed and recorded
Repository policy
-> reference - refs/gittug/policy
tracked by RSL - singed policy metadata
branch, tag, file, folder protection


TUF
key distribution, rotation and revocation
delegations
