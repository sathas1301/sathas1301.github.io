Hello everyone 👋

Not sure where to start or what to write here, so I decided to begin by scribbling down my learnings in the **Cloud** and **Application Security** domains — and anything else related to security.

This is just an introduction post.

I’m **Satwik**, and I started my career in Cyber Security as an **Application Security Engineer** in 2021. Before that, I worked as a software developer for a year.

I think that's enough about me for now — we'll dive into the real learning from the next post! 🚀

I would love to discuss anything security-related and absolutely appreciate people who ask questions, because I believe no software is perfectly perfect and there’s always more to learn. I always keep an open mind to **learn and figure things out**.

Let’s grow and break (things) together 💥🔐
